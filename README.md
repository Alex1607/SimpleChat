# SimpleChat v1.1
[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-red)](https://github.com/willperes/SimpleChat/blob/master/LICENSE.md) [![Spigot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spigot%20Page-English-red)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simplechat.84282/)

I created this plugin just to test some stuff. I am still a beginner in Java, and I still have a lot of stuff to learn, so I started to practice a bit how to code using the Spigot library

The plugin only has one command, that I will show in a bit. The main functions of the plugin are:

- Local chat: The player will be able to send local messages to players that are up to 25 blocks far from you (this value can be changed in the plugin folder file named config.yml).
- Global chat: The player will be able to use the command /g (message) to send messages to all online players.

## Local Chat
